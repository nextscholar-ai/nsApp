# Entity-agnostic merge/rank step. Each entity-specific search service
# (StudentSearchService, TeacherSearchService, ...) runs its own exact +
# fuzzy lookups against its own repository (fields differ per entity)
# and hands the raw hits here. This is the one piece of ranking logic
# that's identical across every entity, so it lives in exactly one
# place instead of being copy-pasted per service.
#
# No database code, no API/schema code here.
