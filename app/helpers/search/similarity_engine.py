#
# The ENTIRE similarity computation lives here, and ONLY here. No
# database code, no API/schema code, no entity-specific knowledge.
#
# This project intentionally does all similarity computation in Python
# (RapidFuzz) rather than in PostgreSQL (pgvector is not used anywhere
# in this codebase - see README "Search Architecture" section). Every
# entity search service (StudentSearchService, TeacherSearchService,
# future ones) pulls a bounded candidate pool from its repository and
# hands it to `rank_candidates` here.
#
# Why RapidFuzz / WRatio:
#   - Pure Python + C extension, no native DB extension, no ML model to
#     download/host, trivial to run anywhere Python runs.
#   - WRatio blends simple ratio, partial ratio, and token-sort ratio,
#     which handles typos, word-order swaps ("Sharma Rahul" vs
#     "Rahul Sharma"), and partial/substring queries well - exactly the
#     shape of "search by name" input real users type.
#
# Swappable by design: everything below this comment is the only place
# that would need to change to swap RapidFuzz for a different algorithm
# (difflib, Levenshtein, cosine-similarity-on-embeddings, ...). No other
# module in the codebase imports rapidfuzz directly.
